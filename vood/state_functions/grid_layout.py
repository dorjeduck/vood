    """
    Arrange states in a rectangular grid formation.

    Positions elements in a grid with configurable spacing, center, and alignment.
    If rows or cols are not provided, the function will attempt to create a nearly square grid.
    Preserves all other state properties (color, scale, opacity, etc.) while only
    modifying x and y positions.

    Args:
        states: List of states to arrange
        rows: Number of rows in the grid (optional)
        cols: Number of columns in the grid (optional)
        spacing_h: Horizontal spacing between elements
        spacing_v: Vertical spacing between elements
        center_x: X coordinate of grid center
        center_y: Y coordinate of grid center
        alignment: How to align each element relative to the grid.
                  PRESERVE keeps original rotation, LAYOUT aligns with grid axes,
                  UPRIGHT starts from vertical position.
        element_rotation: Additional rotation in degrees added to the alignment base.

    Returns:
        New list of states with grid positions
